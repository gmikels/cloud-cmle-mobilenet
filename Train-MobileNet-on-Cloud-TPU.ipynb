    "Machine learning models have two distinct computational components: training and inference. In this example, we’re making use of Cloud TPUs to accelerate training. There are a few lines in the config file that relate specifically to TPU training. We can use a larger batch size when training on TPUs since they make it easier to handle large datasets (when experimenting with batch size on your own dataset, make sure to use multiples of 8 since data needs to be divided evenly for each of the 8 TPU cores). With a larger batch size for our model, we can reduce the number of training steps (in this example we use 2000). The focal loss function we use for this training job, defined in the following lines in the config, is also a great fit for TPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://screenshot.googleplex.com/LkdPseifqst.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This loss function computes loss for every example in the dataset and then reweights them, assigning more relative weight to hard, misclassified examples. This logic is better suited for TPUs than the hard example mining operation used in other training jobs. You can read more about focal loss here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from above that the process of initializing a pre-trained model checkpoint and then adding our own training data is called transfer learning. The following lines in the config tell our model that we’ll be doing transfer learning for object detection, starting from a pre-trained checkpoint.\n",

    "![alt text](https://screenshot.googleplex.com/OuJ9oNqmaxr.png)\n",

    "We also need to consider how our model will be used after it’s been trained. Let’s say our pet detector becomes a global hit, used by animal lovers and pet stores everywhere. We need a scalable way to handle these inference requests with low latency. The output of a machine learning model is a binary file containing the trained weights of our model — these files are often quite large, but since we’ll be serving this model directly on a mobile device we’ll need to make it as small as possible.\n",
